2.The Copyrighted material infringed is located at the following URL(s):
 
        Legitimate site for the game:    http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/wow/
        Legitimate site for the service: https://us.battle.net/login/en/index?ref=http://us.battle.net/wow/en/&app=com-wow
        Blizzard copyright notices: http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/copyrightnotices.html 
 
3.The infringing material is located at the following URL(s):
 
        Infringing site: http://www.wowgaming.org/
        IP: 151.101.33.147

The logon sites are the World of Warcraft emulated servers of the website. 
 
The only authorized service for the game is run by the copyright holder (Activision Blizzard, Inc.) at Battle.net. Your customer's service for the copyrighted game "World of WarCraft" competes with and diminishes the potential market of the copyright holder's own service.
 
Your customer does not have our client’s (the copyrights owner) consent to be running this service for the game. Copyright law protects the entirety of the computer code that creates the game and no one can legally use it without the permission of the copyright owner. Our client has not designated this game as open source nor licensed it to the general public to use it and make changes to the original code. Furthermore, any open source software emulator for the server will still require the use of Blizzard game assets in order to run a World of WarCraft server.
